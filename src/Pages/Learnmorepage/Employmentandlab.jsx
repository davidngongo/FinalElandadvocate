              Eland Advocates is a clear leader in employment and labour law
              matters having consistently and successfully advised some of the
              largest private-sector employers on a variety of concerns in this
              area of the law. <br />
              The integration of the East African labour market presents many
              complex structural and frictional constraints that call for
              harmonization of Labour policies, laws and pro- grammes. <br />{" "}
              East Africa is quickly catching up with the rest of Africa and the
              world at large, and the manner in which human resources operate is
              becoming increasingly complicated in its rapidly changing legal
              environment. Therefore it is imperative to have access to sound
              legal counsel when it comes to dealing with issues related to
              employment. Our expertise has enabled the firm to advise the
              region’s and the world’s leading companies and financial
              institutions on their retirement benefit schemes, fund management
              and associated requirements. <br /> Our team is therefore able to
              give expertise advice on plan design and structure, corporate
              transactions, regulatory issues, corporate governance, employment
              issues, trusts and data protection. Transactional work is central
              to Eland Advocates employment and incentives practice in a variety
              of employment and labour issues under wide circumstances.
              <br />
              In contentious employment cases, Eland Advocates appears in all
              employment courts, defending discrimination and dismissal claims.
              The team’s familiarity with all aspects of law and the various
              developments thereunder emphasizes its commitment to best practice
              in this area.
