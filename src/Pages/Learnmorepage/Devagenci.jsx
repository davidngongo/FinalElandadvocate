              Eland Advocates’ development agencies, inter-governmental and
              not-or-profit organizations team is probably the only specialist
              kind of its nature in our jurisdiction – we have simply
              distinguished ourselves in this line of legal practice and have
              results to show for it. <br />
              Successfully operating in any market, whether international or
              domestic, requires an understanding of that region’s unique
              socioeconomic and geopolitical environments and stakeholders — an
              especially difficult task in markets where stability and
              transparency are often lacking.
              <br />
              Developing markets where the worlds of business, politics and
              ethnic diversity overlap provides the additional challenge of
              navigating the relationships among the individuals, organizations
              and issues that can impact a business. <br />
              Organizations have taken on an increasingly important and
              influential stakeholder role in many of these developing markets
              and can have a profound impact on business operations.
