              Eland advocates’ banking practice team is an accomplished one and
              has recently advised on complex and significant transactions as
              well as successfully guided Commercial banks in their set up from
              principals. No sector has been immune to the impact of the global
              pandemic crisis. Both investment and retail banks have borne the
              brunt of the economic downturn.
              <br /> The financial industry has become more complex, so has the
              regulatory system, which oversees the industry players and their
              activities and runs the risk of lowering the appetite for new
              lending. The interest of protecting savers and investors and
              maintaining financial stability in light of the global pandemic
              has led to increased regulation and this has made it imperative to
              obtain the necessary legal advice in order to deal with the many
              challenges that face corporations within the Industry. <br />{" "}
